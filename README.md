# TPMS Visualizer

A powerful web-based tool for generating, visualizing, and analyzing Triply Periodic Minimal Surface (TPMS) structures with advanced features including sheet-based surfaces, hybrid combinations, and spatially graded properties.

## Features

### Core TPMS Types

- **Gyroid** - Smooth interconnected channels ideal for fluid flow
- **Schwarz P** - Simple cubic symmetry with excellent structural properties
- **Schwarz D** - Diamond-like structure with high surface area
- **Neovius** - Complex cubic structure with unique mechanical properties
- **Primitive** - Classic minimal surface configuration
- **Fischer-Koch** - Twisted channel geometry for complex applications

### Advanced Capabilities

#### Sheet-Based TPMS

- True 3D triangulated surfaces using marching cubes algorithm
- Proper mesh topology for engineering analysis
- Exportable geometry for CAD/FEA software
- Accurate surface area and volume calculations
- Manufacturing-ready STL/OBJ output

#### Hybrid Structures

Combine multiple TPMS types with various blending methods:

- **Union (OR)** - Merge overlapping regions for increased thickness
- **Intersection (AND)** - Keep only common areas to create bridges
- **Weighted Average** - Smooth morphing between different TPMS types
- **Spatial Transition** - Location-based gradual change across the domain
- **XOR (Exclusive)** - Non-overlapping regions only to create channels

#### Graded Structures

Spatially varying thickness and density patterns:

- **Radial** - Center-to-edge gradients for load distribution
- **Linear** - Directional gradients along X, Y, or Z axes
- **Sinusoidal** - Periodic variations for dynamic properties
- **Spherical Shells** - Concentric patterns for impact absorption
- **Cubic Shells** - Angular shell patterns for directional properties

## Applications

- **Structural Engineering** - Lightweight panels, beams, and architectural components
- **Heat Transfer** - Advanced heat exchangers and thermal management systems
- **Biomedical** - Bone scaffolds, tissue engineering, and implant design
- **Aerospace** - Lightweight structures with high strength-to-weight ratios
- **Automotive** - Impact absorption structures and lightweight components
- **Manufacturing** - 3D printing optimized geometries and lattice structures
- **Research** - Material property studies and metamaterial development
